# NI-Embedded-Platform-Mobile-App
This is a joint project with National Instruments which aims to design and complement the mobile application of embedded platform data monitoring. This mobile application replaced the cumbersome embedded devices and would be applied in real product environment in 2018.

###  Workflow

* Settle the embedded data monitoring platform and connect the sensors. 
* Trans the IP address of embedded devices into QR code by our app.
* Download our app and scan the QR code of the device, then the data collected by the embedded devices would be visualized on the smartphone.

### Low degree of coupling ###

Data analysis and the front end are separated, thereby increasing the robustness of the mobile application.

### Visualization 

Allow data monitor to analyze the data collected from embedded data monitoring devices through mobile devices.
